# Java Logical Programs

This repository contains a collection of **Java logical programs** developed to strengthen problem-solving skills and core Java concepts.  
Each program focuses on logic building, condition handling, loops, strings, arrays, and basic algorithms.

These programs were written as part of my **Class 11–12 Computer Science practice** and personal learning.
